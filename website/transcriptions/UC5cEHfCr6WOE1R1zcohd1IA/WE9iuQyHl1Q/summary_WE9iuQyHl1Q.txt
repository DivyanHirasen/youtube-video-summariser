### 🎯 Video Objective
Highlight bullish sentiment around Coreweave, Nvidia, Vertiv, and Dell in the AI infrastructure/ chip space. Discuss export restriction easements in the semiconductor industry and their implications for AI stocks.

---

### 📌 Key Takeaways
1. **Coreweave’s Leadership**: First to deploy Nvidia’s latest GPUs (GB300, NVL72) for AI training and inference, showcasing rapid infrastructure deployment as a competitive moat.
2. **Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra Progress**: GB300 and NVL72 shipping ahead of schedule with strong yields, reversing GB200’s supply chain issues. Analysts may underestimate GB300’s impact.
3. **Vertiv’s AI Infrastructure Role**: Essential partner for AI data center cooling/power, trading at a premium (PE 33.8 vs. 5Y median 20.5), but worth watching for pullbacks to PE 25-26.
4. **Dell Technologies**: AI server business growing ($15B in 2025), shipping 100,000 Nvidia GPUs in 6 weeks for a major client. Trading at a slight premium (PE 12.5 vs. 5Y median 9.7), but less moat than Vertiv.
5. **Export Restriction Easements**: U.S. may relax restrictions on lower-tier chips (e.g., H20) as a trade tactic with China, opening new demand for Nvidia/AMD.
6. **EDA Companies’ Rebound**: Cadence/Synopsis (EDA software) up 5% after U.S. lifted restrictions on shipping tools to China, indirectly benefiting AI chipmakers.
7. **Coreweave’s Valuation**: IPO is expensive; speaker is dollar-cost averaging out despite bullish outlook.
8. **Nvidia’s Valuation**: Trading below 5Y median PE (32.8 vs. 38.27), but speaker isn’t buying more due to large existing position.
9. **AI Factories**: Nvidia/Dell/Vertiv/ Coreweave are key enablers of scalable AI infrastructure, with repeatable templates for global deployment.
10. **One-Way Bets**: AI is a high-stakes market where a few winners (e.g., Nvidia) can outperform portfolios; holding them long-term is pragmatic.

### 💡 Closing Thoughts / Final Recommendations
1. **Top Stocks**: Nvidia (hold/undervalued), Vertiv (watch for PE pullback).
2. **Export Hope**: Eased restrictions could open China market for lower-tier chips.
3. **AI Factory Boom**: Nvidia-led partnerships (Coreweave, Dell, Vertiv) are critical to scaling AI.
4. **Actionable Moves**:
   - Hold Nvidia despite rallies.
   - Consider Vertiv on pullbacks to PE 25-26.
   - Monitor Coreweave’s long-term contracts with AI giants.

**Quote**: *"If the yields are really good, and we’re seeing that they are from results like this, I think that provides at least some evidence. I think the GB300 is going to be what I thought the GB200 was going to be."*
