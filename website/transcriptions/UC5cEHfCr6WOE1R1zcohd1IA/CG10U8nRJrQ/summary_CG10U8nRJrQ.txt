### **🎯 Video Objective**
- Discuss AI/tech stocks, earnings season updates (TSMC, ASML), and market sentiment.
- Analyze stock movements, analyst upgrades/downgrades, and investment theses.
- Highlight potential opportunities (e.g., Nebulus, Oscar Health) and risks (e.g., Micron, Big Bear AI).

### **📌 Key Takeaways**
1. **Nebulus ($NBUS) Upgraded**: Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a **Buy rating** and **$68 PT** (~46% upside), citing AI/cloud demand, software efficiency, and cheap valuation.
2. **Oscar Health Criticized**: Downgraded to **Neutral** (PT cut to **$14**), but CEO’s track record (ex-Allstate/Bridgetower) and focus on changing the health insurance industry are bullish long-term.
3. **Micron ($MU) Bear Thesis**: Downgrades cite **HBM over-supply rumors**, but analyst dismisses concerns, emphasizing HBM innovation and Micron’s innovation in AI.
4. **Big Bear AI ($BBAI) Risky**: Lacks growth (CAGR **9.1%**), low margins (**21%**), and is **overhyped as “next Palantir.”**
5. **SoundHound ($SOUN) Downgraded**: To **Neutral** (PT **$12**) due to execution risks and profitability challenges post-Amelia acquisition.
6. **digitalocean ($DO) Compared to Oracle**: Modest growth (**15.5%** estimates) but trades at **10x earnings**, making it a potential AI play for SMEs.
7. **Rocket Lab ($RKLB) Bullish**: Key for **Neutron launch timing** and DoD contracts; still a **long-term growth bet** (up **500%** for the speaker).
8. **Uber ($UBER) Upgraded**: PT raised to **$109** (from $100) due to pricing power, but autonomous vehicle (AV) competition (Waymo) remains a risk.
9. **Portfolio Strategy**: Concentration matters more than # of stocks; **top holdings drive performance** (e.g., Nvidia).
10. **Market Sentiment**: Pessimism over **30% tariffs on Europe**, **10-year yield >4.4%**, and pre-market red in U.S. stocks.

### **🚫 Companies Criticized or Deprioritized**
1. **Big Bear AI ($BBTi)**: Overhyped (9% growth, 10x sales), lacks near-term revenue catalysts.
2. **SoundHound ($SOUN)**: Against risk of execution delays (Amelia acquisition) and multiple compression.
3. **digitalocean ($DO)**: Flat growth ($14B market cap, 13% revenue growth).

### **🧠 Expert Commentary**
- **Neblus Model**: “Full-stack efficiency and scalable execution differentiate.”
- **Micron Risks**: “Innovation in HBM is key; slipping up in tech could hurt.”
- **Uber AVs**: “If Waymo launches in Miami, it’s a negative for Uber’s multiple, but partnership dynamics may mitigate.”
- **Portfolio Philosophy**: “Not about # of stocks, but concentration in high-conviction picks.”

### **💡 Closing Thoughts / Final Recommendations**
- **Top Picks**: Neblus, Oscar (long-term hold), Micron (if HBM thesis holds), Rocket Lab (space growth).
- **Avoid**: Big Bear AI, SoundHound at current multiples.
- **Monitor**: TSMC/ASML earnings (catalysts for chip sector).
- **Quotes**:
  - *“Invest & then investigate” (Active stock-building strategy).*
  - *“Multi-bagger potential in Neblus, regardless of entry cost.”*
  - *“Over-supply rumors miss Micron’s HBM differentiation.”*
