### 📌 Key Takeaways
1. **Amazon Earnings**:
   - Beat on revenue ($167B vs. $162B expected) and EPS ($168 vs. $133 expected).
   - AWS grew 17.5% YoY (annualized run rate: $123B) but AWS margins declined to 32.9% due to SBC expenses and capex investments.
   - Capex surged to $32B/quarter ($120B+ annual run rate) to meet AI demand, especially for custom AI chips (Tranium 2) and AWS infrastructure.
   - Retail segment growth (11% YoY) driven by Prime Day, same-day delivery expansions, and perishables pilot.

2. **Apple Earnings**:
   - Beat on revenue ($94B vs. $89B expected) and EPS ($157 vs. $143 expected).
   - iPhone sales grew 13% YoY, driven by China growth (4%) and tariff pull-forward demand (1% of growth).

   - Daily active users grew 21% YoY to 110.4M.

   - Revenue missed ($1.5B vs. $1.6B expected) due to lower trading volumes (-38% QoQ).

   - **AI Agents**: Andy Jassy highlighted AWS’s focus on AI inference (Tranium chips, Agent Core infrastructure) over training compute.
   - **Tariff Impact**: Amazon notes no material demand impact yet, but post-tariff cost absorption remains uncertain.

6. **Figma IPO**:
   - Priced at $33, opened at $84, and surged to $122+ on heavy retail demand.
   - Valued at $60B (vs. Adobe’s $150B), with no earnings but 45% YoY revenue growth.

7. **Sector Speed Struggles**:
   - **Google**: Down 2.4% due to App Store antitrust loss vs. Epic Games (30% fee ruling upheld).
   - **Micron**: Down ~5% after Samsung noted HBM3e supply glut and pricing pressure.
   - **ASML**: Criticized for slowing 2026 growth guidance, impacting semiconductors.
