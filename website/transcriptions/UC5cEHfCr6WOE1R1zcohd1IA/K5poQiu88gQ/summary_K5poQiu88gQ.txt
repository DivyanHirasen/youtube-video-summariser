### 📌 **Key Takeaways**
1. **AMD’s Trillion-Dollar Potential**: The speaker believes AMD could hit a $1T market cap in 3–5 years, driven by AI infrastructure demand.
2. **CES 2026 Focus**: Expect consumer-centric announcements (e.g., Ryzen AI 400 laptops, 3D CPUs) but potential hints at data center/AI updates (e.g., MI400 chips).
3. **Memory Shortage Impact**: HBM/DRAM shortages may delay GPU launches or inflate consumer product prices, pushing cloud gaming adoption.
4. **Automotive Push**: AMD will highlight automotive AI solutions (e.g., Verso AI Edge, embedded processors) at CES.
5. **AI Productization**: The next phase of AI is execution, not novelty—real-world applications (e.g., AIPCs for productivity gains).
6. **AIPC Efficiency**: AI tools cut email composition time by 94% (15 mins → 52 sec), saving ~16 work hours/week for businesses.
7. **Quantum Computing**: Long-term focus; not a near-term revenue driver for AMD.
8. **Short-Term Volatility**: CES hype may drive stock swings, but long-term investors should focus on AI infrastructure trends.
9. **Cloud Gaming Thesis**: Memory shortages could accelerate cloud gaming adoption as a cost-effective alternative.
