### 📌 **Key Takeaways**
1. **AI/Semiconductor Rally**: Strong gains in AI-related stocks (e.g., Micron +10%, ASML +9%, Intel +7%) due to market optimism for 2026.
2. **Memory Shortage**: AI chip demand (e.g., Nvidia H200, AMD MI325) may exacerbate HBM3e memory shortages, benefiting Micron.
3. **Adobe’s Bear Thesis**: ADBE stock down ~24% YTD, ~51% over 5 years, but valuation metrics (P/OCF: 14.28, P/FCF: 14.24) are near decade lows.
4. **Adobe’s AI Growth**: AI-driven revenue (e.g., Firefly, Creative Cloud Pro) now >33% of total bookings; generative credits up 3x QoQ.
5. **China AI Chip Market**: AMD’s potential entry into China could boost demand for memory chips.
6. **CES Hype Warning**: Expect short-term volatility from AI hype; focus on long-term trends.
7. **Portfolio Advice**: Avoid comparing stocks; celebrate individual wins (e.g., CoreWeave +10%).
8. **Earnings Focus**: Upcoming earnings from Air Test Systems, TSMC, and others may drive sector moves.
9. **Adobe’s Bull Case**: Strong free cash flow ($9.8B TTM), debt management, and AI integration could reverse the bear thesis.
10. **Investor Sentiment**: Adobe’s long-term underperformance may create a buying opportunity if AI adoption accelerates.
