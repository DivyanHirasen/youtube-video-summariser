### 📌 Key Takeaways
1. **Tech Pullback**: Yesterday’s market saw tech underperform (NVDA, META, TESLA down ~3-4%) while value stocks (UNH, INTC, PYPL) rose. A healthy breather after a multi-month rally.
2. **Figma IPO**: Revenue up **49% YoY**, 95% of F500 customers, **132% NRR**, and **91% gross margins**. Adobe’s failed $20B acquisition shows its strategic value but faces valuation concerns.
3. **Tesla**: Missed Q2 EV deliveries by **0.8k units**, but stock surged **6%** on upside surprise in production and energy storage ( Ljump in Model Y refresh impact).
4. **Oscar Health**: Down **15%** pre-market due to peers’ guidance cuts, but bullish on its preparation for Medicaid/ACA risks and technical signals.
5. **Semiconductors**: Full supply chain exposure (NVDA, AMD, TSM, ASML) is viable but cyclical. Start with ETFs (SMH, SMHX) and cherry-pick individual stocks later.
6. **Macro Outlook**: Fed hints at rate cuts if tariff impacts ease. Tariff deadline (July 9 for Europe) could cause volatility for European-focused stocks.
7. **AI Agents**: Figma and GitLab position as industry-standard tools for collaboration (UI/UX and devops), with AI adding future growth potential.

### 📊 Companies Mentioned

#### **Figma (FGMA)**
- **Role**: UI/UX design platform for app/website development.
- **Investment Case**:
  - **Bull**: High growth (~50%), strong NRR, enterprise adoption. Adobe’s $20B offer implies valuation upside.
  - **Bear**: 25x+ revenue multiple is stretchy; AI could disrupt design automation.

#### **GitLab (GTLB)**
- **Role**: DevSecOps platform for software development.
- **Investment Case**:
  - **Bull**: Integral to engineering workflows, ~30% YoY growth.
  - **Bear**: Operating margin still negative; faces competition (GitHub).

#### **Oscar Health (OSC)**
- **Role**: Health insurance (Medicaid/ACA focus).
- **Investment Case**:
  - **Bull**: Well-positioned vs. peers’ cost woes; technical signals suggest buying opportunity.
  - **Bear**: Volatile sector, but current dip may be overdone.

#### **Tesla (TSLA)**
- **Role**: EV leader + energy storage.
- **Investment Case**:
  - **Bull**: Energy storage growth offsetting EV margin pressures.
  - **Bear**: Lack of affordable model launches since 2024.

#### **Adobe (ADBE)**
- **Role**: Creative software suite.
- **Investment Case**:
  - **Bull**: Valuation attractive; AI moat underappreciated.
  - **Bear**: Growth lags Figma, at risk from AI-driven design tools.

### 🚫 Companies Criticized/Deprioritized
- **Super Micro Computer (SMCI)**: High-risk due to accounting issues and competitive margins. Prefer Dell as a safer alternative.
- **Sentinel Group (Healthcare Peer)**: Down 32% on guidance cut, dragging Oscar Health lower (but Oscar is more resilient).

### 🧠 Expert Commentary
- **"Invest and investigate":** Start small positions to trigger research, not guesswork.
- **AI OS Framework**: "Figma and GitLab are the foundations for AI agents" — future collaboration tools for AI-driven workflows.
- **Tariff Impact**: Fed’s rate-cut stance hinges on tariff data, likely in July/September.

### 💡 Closing Thoughts / Final Recommendations
- **Top Picks**: Figma (if IPO valuation is sane), GitLab, and Oscar Health (short-term speculative entry).
- **Avoid**: SMCI until accounting concerns clear.
- **Themes**: AI collaboration platforms (Figma, GitLab), semiconductor supply chain, and healthcare disruption.
- **Macro**: Tech correction is healthy; stay vigilant on tariff/timing data.
