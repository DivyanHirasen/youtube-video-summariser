### üìå **Key Takeaways**
1. **Tesla Volatility**: Tesla stock is down ~6% pre-market due to Elon Musk‚Äôs political tweets overshadowing positive company news (e.g., robo-taxi launch).
2. **Elon‚Äôs Dual Role**: Musk‚Äôs political commentary (e.g., deficit concerns, third-party proposals) hurts Tesla‚Äôs stock but is a distraction from its core business (AI, energy, robotics).
3. **Holding Strategy**: Long-term holders (like Neil) are not adding significantly at current levels ($300) but won‚Äôt sell unless beneath ~$250.
4. **AI Sector Growth**: Meta, Google, and Nvidia are doubling down on AI infrastructure, suggesting sustained demand despite stock pullbacks.
5. **Valuation Concerns**:
   - Nvidia (near 30% of Neil‚Äôs portfolio) is overvalued at current prices; small DCA may be acceptable.
   - Google is undervalued (e.g., near $174 vs. $150) due to regulatory fears and AI competition fears (despite strong cloud/AI flywheel).
6. **Under-the-Radar Stocks**:
   - **PayPal & Shift4**: Overlooked fintech companies with growth potential.
   - **Recursion (RXRX)**: Speculative AI-drug discovery play; small position for multibagger potential.
   - **ASML**: Semiconductor equipment leader with cyclical tailwinds from chip manufacturing advancements.

7. **Criticism of Stocks**:
   - **Bear AI**: Risky and not aligned with long-term risk/reward profiles.
   - **Adobe**: Market undervalues stability due to fear of AI disruption (though Adobe‚Äôs data shows growth).
   - **Salesforce CEO‚Äôs Microsoft feud**: Viewed as ‚Äúobsession‚Äù rather than strategic competition.

8. **AI Infrastructure**: Data centers and energy demands (e.g., nuclear, solar) are critical but often overlooked by other CEOs (vs. Elon‚Äôs vocal advocacy).
9. **Big Tech Rivalry**:
   - Meta hiring AI talent aggressively (80% from OpenAI/Gemini) signals confidence in AI glasses (vs. Google/Apple).
   - OpenAI using Google Cloud bolstered Nvidia‚Äôs confidence (despite TPU speculation).
