### ðŸŽ¯ **Video Objective**
To analyze pre-market trends, discuss earnings expectations for key companies (Micron, Nike), and share investment insights, including AI-related tech stocks, valuation frameworks, and balance opportunities in non-tech sectors.

### ðŸ“Œ **Key Takeaways**
1. **Micron (MU)**:
   - Strong focus on **HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)** for AI, with HBM4 ramp and high demand (sold out for 2025).
   - Changing reporting segments to **client, embedded, data center, and HPC** for better transparency.
   - Consumer segment slowing but holiday inventory demand Could fuel growth.

2. **NVIDIA (NVDA)**:
   - **Blackwell Ultra chips** shipping by October, likely driving revenue in Q3/Q4.
   - HPE mentions AI servers using B300 Blackwell, signaling enterprise adoption.

3. **AMD (AMD)**:
   - "Advanced money *duplicator*" (formerly destroyer) on strong AI chip demand.
   - MI 355 chip on track, but **no hard sales guidance yet** from management.

4. **Tesla (TSLA)**:
   - **European sales decline** (21.3% YoY), attribute to Chinese EV competition (e.g., **BYD, Chery**).
   - Sales rebounding in key markets (UK, Netherlands, Sweden).

5. **AI/Tech Stocks**:
   - **SoFi, Rocket Lab, and CoreWeave** â€” speculative moves amid FOMO-driven rallies.
   - **Nvdia, AMD, ASML** remain core long positions (**high confidence**).

6. **Non-Tech Opportunities**:
   - **UnitedHealth (UNH)** and **Google (GOOGL)** as defensive plays.
   - **CROX (Crocs) and ABBV (AbbVie)** for value investors (**trailing PE 6â€“7**).

7. **Market Risks**:
   - **Overbought small-cap tech** (e.g., CoreWeave, Cloudflare) suggests possible pullback.
   - Tariff deadlines (July 9) could pressure markets.

8. **Portfolio Strategy**:
   - Focus on **10â€“15 high-conviction stocks** (e.g., NVDA, AMD, Google, ASML).
   - Avoid over-diversification; risk-reward prioritization.

9. **Gap Analysis**:
   - **CoreWeave, Trade Desk** likely to fill gaps due to technical momentum.

10. **AI Tools**:
   - **Nvidia GPT-4, Google Gemini, Perplexity Pro** for research.
   - Paid AI tools pay dividends for content creation and data analysis.

### ðŸš« **Companies Deprioritized**
1. **On Holdings (ONON)** â€” Healthy, but **Nike competitor risk** (nailed by FEDERER sponsorship).
2. **Tesla (TSLA)** â€” Weak EV sales data in Europe.
3. **SkydanceMedia (SKA)** â€” Joke as "future AI wannabe." High volatility.

### ðŸ§  **Expert Commentary**
- **"AI will follow a 3-layer structure: Foundation (NVDA), Infrastructure (MU), Agent (BayArea-based startups)."**
- **Nokia was the advanced money destroyer â†’ Worse but now duplicator** with new AI chip ramping.
- **FOMO risk:** Small-cap tech (e.g., Nebula, CoreWeave) rallies losing to META, MSFT.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Closing Thoughts**
- **Bullish on:** NVDA, MU, AMD (AI ecosystem dominance).
- **Neutral on:** INTC (long turnaround; 4Q visibility needed).
- **Bearish risk:** Tesla, meme tech (overbought).

**Quote:**
*"If the thing if a company makes changes to the reporting, if it makes sense, Iâ€™m all for it. If it doesnâ€™t, then screw them."*

**Final Pick:**
**NVDA, MÑ†Ð°Ñ‚Ð°, GOOGL** (long); niche value in **CROX, ABBV**.
