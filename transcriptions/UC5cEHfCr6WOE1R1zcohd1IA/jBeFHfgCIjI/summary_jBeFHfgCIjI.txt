- AI cloud data center providers and Bitcoin mining companies pivoting to AI infrastructure
- Macro data (US non-farm payrolls, unemployment, wage growth)

---

### 📌 **Key Takeaways**
1. **OpenAI-Oracle Deal**:
   - OpenAI will lease **4.5 gigawatts** of data center power from Oracle, extending the Stargate AI infrastructure project.
   - Expected to drive demand for Nvidia/AMD GPUs; Oracle partners with both but Nvidia will likely dominate (80%+ share).
   - Bullish for Nvidia (**$180B+ revenue** from Stargate alone, per Jensen Huang’s math).

2. **US-China Chip Software Restrictions**:
   - US lifted export bans on **EDA software (e.g., Cadence, Synopsys)**, signaling diplomatic progress.
   - **Cadence +4.6%**, **Synopsys +4%**. No impact on AMD/Nvidia’s hardware export bans yet.
   - More chip export restrictions (e.g., H100, Blackwell) are likely negotiating tools, not permanent.

3. **Fintech Stocks**:
   - **Weeble (WBL)**:
     - Similar to Robinhood; operates globally, low market cap ($6.4B).
     - Revenue up **32% YoY**, operating income positive last quarter.
     - Concern: Only **4.7/24.1M registered users** fund accounts (key to monetization).

4. **AI Cloud Providers**:
   - **IronSource (ISR)**: Purchased **2,400 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs**, expanding AI cloud services. Stock up **53% in 2 weeks**.
   - **Nvidia’s Leptin AI Marketplace**:
     - Could disrupt smaller cloud providers (e.g., Coreweave, Nebius) by standardizing bare-metal pricing.
     - **Risk**: Nvidia’s dominance in AI supply chain may squeeze margins for competitors.

5. **Bitcoin Mining Stocks Pivoting to AI**:
   - Companies like **Applied Digital (ADG)**, **HIVE (HIVE)**, **Riot (RIOT)** are repurposing infrastructure for AI data centers.
   - Speculative plays; **most are still penny stocks** ($1–$10 range).

6. **Macro Data**:
   - **US non-farm payrolls +147K (vs. +106K est.)**, unemployment **4.1% (vs. 4.3% est.)**.
   - **Wages up 3.7% YoY**; strong data may delay Fed rate cuts.

|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **OpenAI**         | AI foundation                     | – Expansion with Oracle showcases cloud needs for AI training.                   |
| **Oracle**         | Cloud infrastructure              | – Stargate project may generate **$30B+ annually** post-2028.                   |
| **Nvidia**         | AI accelerator leader             | – Dominates Oracle deal; **80%+ GPU share** expected.                           |
| **AMD**           | AI chip competitor                | – Potential upside if new products (e.g., MI300) secure Oracle/Stargate contracts. |
| **Cadence**       | EDA software (chip design)        | – Stock **+5%** post-US easing of China bans.                                    |
| **Synopsys**      | EDA peer                          | – Similar to Cadence; benefits from rule relaxation.                            |

### 🚫 **Companies Criticized/Deprioritized**
1. **Bitcoin Mining Stocks (WOLF, MIGI, HUT)**:
   - Considered **degenerate plays** due to volatility and speculative AI pivots.

2. **Robinhood (HOOD)****:
   - Bull thesis depends on sustained market rallies; transaction-based revenue remains fragile.

---

### 🧠 **Expert Commentary**
- **Nvidia’s Leptin AI**:
  - Could act as a "Uber for AI cloud infrastructure," introducing pricing pressure on smaller providers.
- **China-US Chip Dynamics**:
  - US export bans are **negotiating tools**; H100/Blackwell restrictions may ease if trade talks progress.
- **AI Cloud Providers**:
  - Specialized firms (e.g., Coreweave) will compete by **offering lower pricing** than AWS/Azure.

### 💡 **Closing Thoughts**
**Final Picks**:
- **Nvidia**: Buy dips; Oracle deal confirms long-term AI dominance.
- **Weeble**: Monitor funded accounts growth; **$145/market cap $6.4B** attractive if adoption climbs.
- **IronSource (ISR)**: High risk/reward; **AI cloud pivot** is speculative but volatile.
