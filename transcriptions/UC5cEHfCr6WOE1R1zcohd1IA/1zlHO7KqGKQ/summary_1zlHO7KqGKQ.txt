### ðŸ“Œ **Key Takeaways**
1. **Micronâ€™s Earnings Beat Expectations**:
   - Revenue: **$9.3B** (+37% YoY), **5% above estimates**.
   - EPS: **$1.91** (+19% YoY).
   - Guidance: **$10.7B** next quarter (midpoint), **42% gross margins**.
   - Stock down despite strong results due to recent run-up.

2. **Balance Sheet & Cash Flow**:
   - **$10.8B cash** (increasing) vs. **$15B long-term debt** (rising due to facility expansions).
   - **Free cash flow: $1.9B (TTM)**, reflecting cyclical memory market volatility.

3. **Memory Market Shifts**:
   - **HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)** is reducing commodity-like price swings, supporting margins.
   - Risk: Innovation slowdown could revert the sector to cyclicality.

4. **Bullish Signals for AMD & Nvidia**:
   - **Data center AI servers**: Mid-single-digit growth in 2025 (critical for Nvidia, which gets **90% of revenue** from data centers).
   - **PC market**: Low single-digit growth in 2025, but **AMD is gaining market share** (35% of AMDâ€™s revenue).
   - **Embedded/AI adoption**: Resurgence in industrial/automotive markets (12% of AMDâ€™s revenue).

5. **Gaming Market Note**:
   - **Nvidiaâ€™s gaming revenue** ($3.8B last quarter) is smaller but can still drive upside.
